                            <p class="lead">Count Your Money is a place to keep track of your money over time. Every now and then you count the money in all your accounts, and enter it into the app. You can do it weekly or monthly or erratically. As you keep tracking it, you'll get some easy to understand information on your financial progress and your future.</p>

                            <h4>1. Counting</h4>
                            <p class="lead">Recording the balances of your accounts on a somewhat regular interval is your main action.</p>
                            <p>First, you'll want to set up all your accounts in the Settings, by clicking the gear icon and going to Accounts. Your accounts can be positive, like a savings account, or negative, like a loan.</p>
                            <p>For including major assets like a home, you can include both the equity as a positive account, and the mortgage balance as a negative account. Or, you can leave both of them out if you consider your house to be a place to live and don't want to consider it as an investment.</p>
                            <p>You can record your balances at any interval -- weekly, monthly, etc. You can also record them on a non-standard schedule and the app will do its best to smooth it out. So don't worry if you miss a week, or you're a couple days late. Just record your balances when you can.</p>
                            <p>You record your balances, by clicking Count and just filling out the lines. It will calculate the total and save everything automatically.</p>
                            <p>If you want to record for a previous day -- say you wrote them down but didn't have the app handy -- you can go to the Calendar and select any other day. To get to the Calendar, click the date just underneath Account Balances.</p>

                            <p>This section can show you the value of your short-term savings. Sometimes it can feel like you're not making any savings progress, but seeing a continual slope upwards can show how powerful your constant progress is.</p>
                            <p>Likewise, this can show you if you're not making any positive progress. It can be a warning sign or a confirmation of modified habits.</p>

                            <p class="lead">The Future is a rough projection of where you can expect your overall balance to be, and when
                                you might expect to be able to be financially independent.</p>
                            <p>This page uses some assumptions that you can set up in the Settings, under Numbers. You can set your retirement target, expected returns, and what sort of retirement salary you'd like to withdraw.</p>
                            <p>By default, it also uses the 4% rule to determine your withdrawal amounts. If you're not sure on the 4% rule, do a web search. You may want to adjust this value, for example, to be lower for a conservative early retirement, or higher if you'll have another income source like a pension.</p>
                            <p>It also uses your balances to determine how much you're contributing annually. This is a number that can easily be the most inaccurate, particularly if you haven't used the app for very long.</p>
                            <p>So don't take this as accurate, especially early on, but instead use it as a loose guideline and a way to learn about retirement savings concepts.</p>
