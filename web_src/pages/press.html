                                <strong>Grapefruit is a mental health management app</strong>.
                                It combines a journal, a mood and emotion tracker, and a daily personal check-in system based around customizable self-questioning.
                                It then analyzes the data and generates charts, graphs and other data points that users can use to find patterns in their moods, feelings and behaviors.

                            <p>
                                In addition to a self-help tool, Grapefruit can be used along with many kinds of therapy and counseling. Many users currently use it for exactly that.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The future of Grapefruit will also be based around support relationships.
                                So you could use it on your own, share with a trusted person in your life, work with a therapist / counselor, or any combination thereof.
                                Our goal is to be a mental health tool that everyone can use, no matter how your journey is unfolding.

                            <h2>About The Creator</h2>
                            <p class="lead">Grapefruit was created by Angus Woodman, a Canadian software developer and entrepreneur.</p><p> In his own words:</p>
                            <blockquote style="border-left:4px solid #ccc; padding-left:10px;">
                            <p>
                                <em>I created what would become Grapefruit almost ten years ago, at a particularly low point in my own life.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>I was dealing with depression and anxiety and social isolation, though I hadn't yet applied those words to what I had
                                been experiencing to that point. Being catastrophically bad at asking for help, I thought I'd see if I could 'hack' my way
                                to feeling better.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>I started doing research on moods and happiness. I then made a bunch of tools to gather and analyze data, and
                                used myself as a guinea pig over the next year.
                                And it made a big difference. So I took the tools that gave me the most benefit, wrapped them up and put it out 
                                there for folks to use.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p><em>Eight years later, I rebuilt it from the ground-up, incorporating everything I learned, and called it Grapefruit.</em></p>
